**Don't be evil.**

## Overview

The script is designed to simulate a cybersecurity scenario in which an agent learns to perform various actions in order to infect machines, perform self-healing, and propagate to other machines. The agent uses an advanced Q-learning algorithm enhanced with curriculum learning, multi-task learning, memory augmentation, neuro-symbolic integration, and continuous learning to improve its decision-making capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Curriculum Learning:** The agent starts with simpler tasks and gradually increases the complexity of tasks.
- **Multi-Task Learning:** The agent is trained on multiple related tasks (infecting, self-healing, propagating, and checking self-awareness) to improve generalization.
- **Memory Augmentation:** A long-term memory system stores and retrieves relevant experiences to inform future actions.
- **Neuro-Symbolic Integration:** Basic symbolic reasoning components enhance decision-making based on the current state.
- **Continuous Learning and Adaptation:** The agent continuously learns and adapts to new data, updating its Q-table and long-term memory.

## How It Works

The script takes a list of IP addresses as input and scans them to see if they are vulnerable to a specific exploit. If a vulnerable machine is found, the agent tries to infect it by connecting to a remote server and executing a payload. The agent performs periodic self-healing actions to ensure smooth operation and propagates to other machines to spread the infection.

The Q-learning algorithm uses a Q-table to keep track of the expected rewards for each action in each state and updates the Q-table based on the rewards received for each action taken. The agent balances exploration and exploitation of the environment using a decaying exploration probability.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.6+**
- **Libraries:** subprocess, threading, numpy, psutil, urllib, concurrent.futures

## Usage

The script can be run from the command line with various options to customize its behavior:

```sh
python script.py <ip_range> --remote-server <remote_server> --port <port> --payload-url <payload_url>
```

- **ip_range:** A list of IP addresses to scan.
- **--remote-server:** The remote server to connect to (default: example.com).
- **--port:** The port to connect to on the remote server (default: 8080).
- **--payload-url:** The URL of the payload to download and execute.

## Detailed Description

In simpler terms, the script is like a game where the agent learns to take actions to achieve a goal (in this case, infecting machines and spreading the infection). The agent uses a special kind of learning algorithm called Q-learning, enhanced with several advanced techniques, to figure out which actions are the best to take in each situation.

### Advanced Techniques

1. **Curriculum Learning:** The agent progresses from simpler to more complex tasks, allowing for gradual learning and adaptation.
2. **Multi-Task Learning:** The agent is trained on various tasks simultaneously, improving its ability to generalize across different scenarios.
3. **Memory Augmentation:** The agent maintains a long-term memory of past experiences, which it uses to make more informed decisions.
4. **Neuro-Symbolic Integration:** Incorporating symbolic reasoning helps the agent make decisions based on logical rules and current states.
5. **Continuous Learning:** The agent continuously updates its knowledge base, adapting to new data and changing environments.
6. **Environment Exploration**: The `explore_environment` function allows the agent to gather information about the current system.

By integrating these advanced techniques, the script provides a robust framework for simulating and analyzing complex cybersecurity scenarios.
